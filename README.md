# Water-Jug Problem Solved by a Q-Learner

## Water-Jug Problem
The water-jug problem is an old puzzle that is usually stated as follows:

``You have two jugs, a 4-litre one and a 3-litre one. There are no markings on the jugs and you can fill them with water from a tap. You have to get exactly 2 litres of water in the 4-litre jug.''

Solving the problem mentally requires imagining filling, emptying and pouring water from the jugs. The problem has a specific goal, 2 liters of water in the 4-litre jug, that has to be achieved from a given starting point, where both jugs are empty.
